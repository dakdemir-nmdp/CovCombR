Description: Implements the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to combine
    incomplete covariance (or genetic relationship) matrices into a single
    data-scale covariance estimate. Inputs are covariance submatrices with
    associated degrees of freedom. The latent Wishart representation supports
    heterogeneous scaling and completeness diagnostics, while the package returns
    the combined covariance alongside optional standard errors obtained via plugin
    or bootstrap methods. Numerical stability is ensured through Cholesky
    decompositions, ridge regularisation, and positive-definiteness projection.
