\title{Check Graph Connectivity of Observation Pattern}
\usage{
.check_graph_connectivity(p, observed_sets)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Integer. Total number of variables.}

\item{observed_sets}{List of integer vectors. Each element contains the
indices of variables observed together in one sample.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
  \item{is_connected}{Logical. TRUE if all variables form a single connected component.}
  \item{num_components}{Integer. Number of connected components.}
  \item{component_map}{Integer vector of length p. Maps each variable to its component number.}
}
\description{
Performs a connectivity analysis on the observation pattern to determine
whether all variables can be estimated jointly. Variables are connected if
they appear together in at least one observation set, either directly or
through a chain of observations.
}
\details{
This function constructs an undirected graph where:
\itemize{
  \item Vertices represent variables (1 to p)
  \item An edge exists between variables i and j if they appear together in any observation set
}

The function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to identify connected components.
A connected graph (num_components == 1) is required for identifiable parameter estimation.

Variables that never appear in any observation set form singleton components.
